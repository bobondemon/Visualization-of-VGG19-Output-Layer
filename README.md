# VGG19 VISUALIZATION
Aim to visualize the final fully-connected layer's hidden units
This is an implemetation of [Visualizing higher-layer features of a deep network](http://igva2012.wikispaces.asu.edu/file/view/Erhan+2009+Visualizing+higher+layer+features+of+a+deep+network.pdf)
> find the optimal stimulus for each unit by performing gradient descent in image space to maximize the units activation

See Visualization-of-VGG19.ipynb for the codes and results
